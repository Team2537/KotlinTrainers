# Constructors

Constructors are used to initialize properties of a class. They are called when an object is created.

## Declaring constructors

Constructors are declared in the class body using the `init` keyword, usually at the top:

```kotlin
class MyClass {
    init {
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Constructor parameters

You can pass parameters to the constructor similar to how you pass parameters to a function.

```kotlin
class MyClass(a: Int, b: Int) {
    init {
        println(a + b)
    }
}
```
