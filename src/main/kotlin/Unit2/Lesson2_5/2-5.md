# Data Classes

Data classes are a special type of class that Kotlin provides. They are used to hold data, and don't have methods or functions. They are very useful for holding data that you want to pass around your program.

To create a data class, you use the `data` keyword before the `class` keyword. You can then define the properties of the class, and Kotlin will automatically generate the `equals()`, `hashCode()`, `toString()`, and `copy()` methods for you.

```kotlin
data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)
```

You can then create instances of the class like this:

```kotlin
val person = Person("John", 25)
```

You can access the properties of the class like this:

```kotlin
println(person.name)
println(person.age)
```

You can also use the `copy()` method to create a copy of the class, with some of the properties changed:

```kotlin
val person2 = person.copy(name = "Jane")
```

As you can see, data classes function almost identically to normal classes, but they are much easier to use when you just want to store data.
